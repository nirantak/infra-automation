## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nirantak/ansible-setup.git
cd ansible-setup
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml

# To set up pre-commit hooks, required for contributing code, run:
pre-commit install --install-hooks --overwrite

# On macOS, if you need to use the `-k` flag with ansible-playbook, run:
brew install nirantak/tap/sshpass
```

Update the following files to your liking:

- `inventory.ini` (replace IP address with your server's IP, or use `127.0.0.1` and add `connection=local` at the end if you're running it on the machine you're setting up).
- `group_vars/<group>.yml` to update the config for any host group from the inventory.

## Playbooks

### rpi

> _Raspberry Pi setup and config for all things Internet_

- Download [Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-64-bit) and flash it on a Micro SD Card using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
- From the [here](roles/raspberry_pi/files/boot) copy the required files to the `/boot` partition of the Raspberry Pi SD Card to enable certain features:
  - Copy the `ssh` file as is, to enable ssh on first boot, so that a monitor or keyboard is not required for setup.
  - Update and copy the `config.txt` file to edit the boot configuration.
  - Update and copy the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file to enable WiFi, or connect an ethernet cable.
- Once you are able to ssh into the rpi using the default credentials, run the ansible playbook to set it up.
- Update the config file [group_vars/rpi.yml](group_vars/rpi.yml) as per your needs.
- This setup assumes a Debian based rpi image (like Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu).

```bash
# To run the entire setup:
ansible-playbook playbooks/raspberry_pi.yml -k
# Only use the `-k` flag the first time, so that you can enter the default ssh password.
# This is not needed once key-based ssh is setup.

# Or run select tasks or roles using tags:
ansible-playbook playbooks/raspberry_pi.yml -t ping
```

- For backup for Pi-hole at least, in the GUI you can go to Settings > Teleporter and click 'Backup'. To automate it through the console, you can run `pihole -a -t`.

#### Pi-hole

Installs the Pi-hole for network-wide ad-blocking and local DNS. Make sure to update your network router config to direct all DNS queries through your Raspberry Pi if you want to use Pi-hole effectively.

**Pi-hole**: Visit the Pi's IP address (e.g. http://192.168.1.40/) and use the `pihole_password` you configured in your `config.yml` file (default is `password`).

### macOS

> _Mac dev env setup and configuration_

- Update the config file [group_vars/mac.yml](group_vars/mac.yml) as per your needs, to select what software you want to install or configure.

```bash
# Install xcode command line tools
xcode-select --install

# To run the entire setup:
ansible-playbook playbooks/mac_dev_setup.yml -k
# Using the `-k` flag you can enter you macOS password before the playbook runs

# Or run select tasks or roles using tags:
ansible-playbook playbooks/mac_dev_setup.yml -k -t ping
```
